# Project Documentation

Welcome to the extended documentation for **JobInsight Data Pipeline**. This section dives deeper into architecture, data modelling, deployment strategies, and monitoring practices that complement the high-level overview provided in the root `README.md`.

> Tip: GitHub now natively supports Mermaid diagrams. If a diagram does not render, ensure the `?plain=1` suffix is *not* present in the URL and you are viewing the file on GitHub.com.

## Table of Contents
1. [Architecture](architecture.md)
2. [Data Model](data_model.md)
3. [Deployment](deployment.md)
4. [Monitoring](monitoring.md)

Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you spot any outdated information or would like to propose improvements to the documentation.
